Project Title: Web Log Analysis

Description:
The objective of this project is to perform a comprehensive analysis of web server logs to gain insights into website traffic, identify potential issues, and assess overall system performance. The analysis focuses on key metrics such as HTTP response codes, top 10 frequent endpoints, top 10 error endpoints, total unique hosts, and the occurrence of error 404 response codes.

Methods and Steps:

Data Collection:

Collect web server logs from the target system or use a provided dataset.
Data Preprocessing:

Clean and preprocess the raw log data, extracting relevant information such as IP addresses, timestamps, HTTP methods, response codes, and endpoint paths.
HTTP Response Code Analysis:

Calculate the distribution of HTTP response codes to understand the overall health of the web server.
Identify and categorize different types of response codes (e.g., 2xx, 3xx, 4xx, 5xx).
Top 10 Frequent Endpoints:

Analyze and identify the top 10 most frequently accessed endpoints to gain insights into popular content or services.
Top 10 Error Endpoints:

Identify and list the top 10 endpoints associated with the highest occurrence of error response codes (4xx and 5xx).
Analyze the potential reasons for errors on these endpoints.
Total Unique Hosts:

Count the total number of unique IP addresses (hosts) accessing the web server to gauge the diversity of visitors.
404 Error Code Analysis:

Specifically, analyze occurrences of the 404 error code (Page Not Found).
Identify the endpoints associated with 404 errors and investigate potential broken links or missing content.
Visualization:

Create visualizations such as bar charts, pie charts, or line graphs to represent the distribution of response codes, top endpoints, and other key metrics.
Utilize tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn, or any preferred visualization library for graphical representation.
